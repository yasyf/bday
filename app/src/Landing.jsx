          This year, for my <b>25th</b> (!!) birthday, I'm reaching out to a
          handful of my closest friends and asking them to join me in Hawaii for
          a weekend of food and fun.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.noMargin}>
          The dates are Jan. 31st to Feb. 2nd. As one of the people in my life
          whose friendship I truly treasure, I sincerely hope you'll be able to
          make it out.

      </Heading>
      <Heading heading={3}>
        <p className={classes.spaceBelow}>
          I understand this is a huge thing to ask of you, both in terms of time
          and cost.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.noMargin}>
          Hopefully, the prospect of spending a weekend on a beach, surrounded
          by incredible people and beautiful weather, is enough to convince you
          to take a leap here. The trip simply won't be the same without you.

          Of course, I know that everyone is unbelievably overwhelmed and
          overcommitted these days, and between work, friends, family, and
          simply staying sane, there might not be an opportunity to take a trip
          like this.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.noMargin}>
          If that's the case, I completely understand, and I hope you'll be able
          to join whatever crazy scheme I cook up next year.
